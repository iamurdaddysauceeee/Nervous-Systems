            <p>The nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord, and a
			complex network of nerves.<br/> This system sends messages back 
			and forth between the brain and the body.</p>
			

            <p>The brain is what controls all the body's functions.
			The spinal cord runs from the brain down through the back.<br/>
			It contains threadlike nerves that branch out to every organ
			and body part. This network of nerves relays messages<br/> back
			and forth from the brain to different parts of the body.</p>

			<h2 style="color:#07005b";><li>What are the parts of the Nervous System?</h2></li>
			<p>The nervous system is made up of the <b>central nervous system</b>and the 
			<b>peripheral nervous system:</b></p>
			<hr>
			
			<h2 style="color:#07005b";><li>How does the Nervous System work?</h2></li>
			<p>The nervous system uses tiny cells called neurons (NEW-ronz)
			to send messages back and forth from the brain,<br/> through 
			the spinal cord, to the nerves throughout the body.</p>
			<p>Billions of neurons work together to create a communication network.
			Different neurons have different jobs.<br/> For example, sensory
			neurons send information from the eyes, ears, nose, tongue,
			and skin to the brain.<br/> Motor neurons carry messages away 
			from the brain to the rest of the body to allow muscles to
			move.<br/> These connections make up the way we think, learn,
			move, and feel. They control how our bodies work â€” regulating<br/>
			<b>breathing, digestion,</b> and the beating of our <b>hearts.</b>
